Installation

Requirements:
- PHP 8.4+ (Compatible with modern PHP features)
- MySQL or MariaDB database server
- A web server (Apache or Nginx)
- Access **AniList** API
- FTP client (for file upload) (or alternate file transfer method of your preference)

Steps to Install:
1. **Download the files**: 
   Download the files from the GitHub repository or the provided link.

2. **Upload the files via FTP**:
   Use your FTP client (such as FileZilla) to upload the files to your web server. Upload all the contents of the repository (including subfolders) to the desired location on your server.
   If youre on Xampp windows drop the files into the "htdocs" directory

4. **Set up the database**:
   - Create a MySQL or MariaDB database on your web server.
   - Import the provided SQL schema to create the necessary tables (e.g., `users`, `anime`, `manga`).

5. **Configure the `config.php`**:
   - Open `config/config.php` and enter your **MAL**, **AniList**, and **Jikan API** keys.
   - Set the booleans `$myanimelist` and `$anilist` to `true` to enable integration with those platforms. If you donâ€™t want to use them, set them to `false`.

6. **Set up a web server** (Apache or Nginx):
   - Ensure that your server has PHP 8.4+ installed.
   - For **Apache**: Ensure `mod_rewrite` is enabled and configure `.htaccess` for clean URLs.
   - For **Nginx**: Make sure your server block is configured to point to the root directory where you uploaded the files.

7. **Access the website**:
   - Once the files are uploaded and configured, open your web browser and navigate to your website's URL (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com`). The website should be live and ready for use.

Usage

- **Login**: Users can log in with their **MyAnimeList** or **AniList** accounts to sync their anime and manga progress.
- **Streaming**: Once logged in, users can stream anime or read manga while their progress is tracked automatically.
- **Progress Sync**: When a user finishes an episode or chapter, the website will update their progress on **MAL** or **AniList**, depending on the configuration.
- **Dashboard**: Users can view their current anime/manga list and progress through a personal dashboard.

Configuration

1. **API Integration**:
   - You must configure your l**AniList** API credentials in the `config.php`. You can obtain these from their respective developer platforms.

2. **Enable/Disable API Features**:
   - Set `$anilist = true;` to enable **AniList** integration, or `false` to disable.

3. **Database Configuration**:
   - In the `config.php` file, update the `$database` array to match your database connection details (host, username, password, etc.).

4. **Web Server Configuration**:
   - The site is built to run on a typical PHP web server. Make sure you configure your server (Apache/Nginx) to serve the files correctly.
