Installation

Requirements:
- PHP 8.4+ (Compatible with modern PHP features)
- MySQL or MariaDB database server
- A web server (Apache or Nginx)
- Composer (for dependency management)
- Access to MyAnimeList and AniList APIs

Steps to Install:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/anime-streaming-website.git
   cd anime-streaming-website

2. Install dependencies using Composer:
   composer install

3. Set up the database:
   - Create a MySQL or MariaDB database for your project.
   - Import the provided SQL schema to set up the necessary tables (e.g., users, anime, manga).

4. Configure the config.php:
   - Open config/config.php and add your MAL, AniList, and Jikan API keys.
   - Set the booleans $myanimelist and $anilist to true to enable integration with those platforms. If you donâ€™t want to use them, set them to false.

5. Set up a web server (Apache or Nginx):
   - For Apache: Ensure mod_rewrite is enabled and configure .htaccess for clean URLs.
   - For Nginx: Configure your server block to point to the public directory.

6. Run the application:
   - Navigate to your server's URL (e.g., http://localhost/), and the website should be up and running.

Usage

- Login: Users can log in with their MyAnimeList or AniList accounts to sync their anime and manga progress.
- Streaming: Once logged in, users can stream anime or read manga, while their progress is tracked automatically.
- Progress Sync: When a user finishes an episode or chapter, the website will update their progress on MAL or AniList, depending on the configuration.
- Dashboard: Users can view their current anime/manga list and progress through a personal dashboard.

Configuration

1. API Integration:
   - You must configure your MAL and AniList API credentials in config/config.php. You can obtain these from their respective developer platforms.

2. Enable/Disable API Features:
   - Set $myanimelist = true; to enable MAL integration, or false to disable.
   - Set $anilist = true; to enable AniList integration, or false to disable.

3. Database Configuration:
   - In the config.php file, update the $database array to match your database connection details (host, username, password, etc.).

4. Web Server Configuration:
   - The site is built to run on a typical PHP web server. Make sure you configure your server (Apache/Nginx) to serve the files correctly.
